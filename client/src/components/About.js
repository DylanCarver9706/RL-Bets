      <p>
        RL Bets is a platform to place bets on professional Rocket League
        tournaments. The idea was always there. Rocket League is a sport with a
        ball, so it is only fair that we should be able to bet on that. The
        motivation to make this came when I attended RLCS in 2024 in Dallas,
        Texas and heard a group of people one row behind me keeping track of how
        many demos a particular team would have in a series. Their bet was
        either over/under 30 demos. Though I couldn't hear what they were
        wagering for this, it didn't matter because this bet brought them
        together and made them look at the game differently. From the triple
        flips resets to the own goals, there is always something amazing about
        Rocket League we can be excited about. That is how I view the game, and
        this is my contribution to the amazing community of Rocket League
